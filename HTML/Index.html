Given the class hierarchy below, possible locations for these functions are: i. getld is implemented in the superclass ii. getld is implemented in the subclass iii. getName is an abstract function in the superclass iv. getName is implemented in the superclass v. getName is implemented in the subclass vi. getSalary is an abstract function in the superclass vii. getSalary is implemented in the superclass viii. getSalary is implemented in the subclass
